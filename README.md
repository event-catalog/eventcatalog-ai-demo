# EventCatalog AI Demo

This is a demo of how to use AI to ask questions about your EventCatalog.

This demo uses [git2txt](https://github.com/addyosmani/git2txt) to extract the text from the git repo and uses this for the LLM context.

How to run the demo:

1. Clone the repo or [Create your own EventCatalog](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/)
2. Run npx `git2txt https://github.com/event-catalog/eventcatalog-ai-demo` (replace with your repo)
3. Open your AI Agent and add the context from the previous step.
4. Ask questions about your EventCatalog!
